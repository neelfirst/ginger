# ginger

Ginger is a webapp written in Python3 and Flask. Ginger has two missions:
- Given an equity, provide some good value options, determined by risk and return
- Given an option, provide some pricing history relative to the equity

Ginger should "suggest" good value options for the following strategies:
- Long call
- Strangles
- Others TBD

And display pricing data for those options, along with the equity pricing.

Ginger is not an in-depth research tool. It is just an ultralight options assistant and monitor.
